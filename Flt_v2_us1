BG - Blueprint graph
CG - Context graph

* Start state
    - Action Node = []
    - Active Nodes = [USER]

** Start
U0: 
    - Q1 on BG: always_active = true
    - C1 on CG: Create always active nodes in the context graph
    - C2 on CG: Create related nodes from long term memory


U1: Hi
    - Prediction skills:: [SKILL_GREETINGS]
    - Prediction concepts: []
    - Node Recommendation: Query all the nodes and edges by skill id -> GREETINGS Node
    - Node is already unlocked by default.
    - Send the text/voice response [Hi, how can I help?]
    - Next Evaluator: Determine QRs
    - Memory Manager:
        : Action Node = [GREETINGS]
        : Active Nodes = [USER, GREETINGS]
        : DELETE MODE -
            . NEXT MESSAGE = [SKILL_GREETINGS]

U2: What's the status of my flight?
    - Prediction skills: [SKILL_GET_FLIGHT_STATUS]
    - Prediction concepts: []
    - Node Recommendation: [FLIGHT_STATUS]
    - Nothing to be done from Dimension and Depth Resolvers as there is only one recommended node
    - Path Finder
        : Check for dependency nodes
            FLIGHT_STATUS -> FLIGHT_SEGMENT
            FLIGHT_SEGMENT -> FLIGHT_NUMBER | departure & arrival
        : Path Resolver: choose FLIGHT_NUMBER
    - Node Execution Service <-- FLIGHT_NUMBER
        : Ask question [What's the flight number?]
    - Next Evaluator: Determine QRs
    - Memory Manager:
          : Action Node = [FLIGHT_NUMBER]
          : Active Nodes = [USER]
